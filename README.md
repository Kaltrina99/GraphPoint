# GraphPoint

The provided code is a C# console application that performs the following tasks:

1. **Reading Input:** It locates an input file named "input.txt" in the project directory and reads a list of points from it.

2. **Finding Furthest Points:** The program calculates and identifies the furthest points from the origin (0,0) and their respective quadrants.

3. **Graphical Representation:** It generates a graphical representation of the points on a grid and displays it.

4. **Output:** The program saves the furthest points and their quadrant information to an output file named "output.txt."

Key components of the code include functions to read points from a file, calculate distances, determine quadrants, and display a graphical representation of the points.

The code also handles exceptions and checks for the existence of the input file.
